### Setting social media links

Open the file `social-media.hbs` located in `/partials/` folder.

### Editing footer

Open the file `footer.hbs` located in `/partials/` folder.

### Editing CSS/SCSS files.

**Sticko** is developed on top of [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/install) and [Compass](http://compass-style.org/install), which means that you are going to need both running on your own machine; follow both guides to set up the proper environment.
